### 1.6 ASU / KV metrics

ASU forwards these 37 KV metrics (23 Counters and 14 Histograms) into the UCM collector. Names below use the default `ucm:` prefix. Submission counts describe KV API calls and entries, not unique inference requests or successful asynchronous completions.

**Units:** all `kv_*_duration_seconds` observations and bucket boundaries are in seconds. Existing `*_duration_ms` metrics, `save_duration` and `save_completion_wait_duration` use milliseconds. Multiply a KV duration mean or quantile by `1000` when displaying milliseconds; do not combine seconds and milliseconds without conversion.

The two `kv_transport_node_task_*` histograms retain `node_id` in standalone mode. The UCM adapter aggregates their observations across nodes and does not expose that node label; other exporter labels still apply.

#### Installation switches

In both Direct and HMA connector paths, ASU adapter installation requires the top-level `enable_metrics` switch (default `true`), a nonempty effective metrics configuration, at least one enabled consumer (`vllm_connector` or `multiproc`), and the store-level `ucm_connectors[].ucm_connector_config.enable_metrics` switch (default `true`). The built-in configuration enables `vllm_connector`; a custom `consumers` mapping with both consumers disabled prevents installation. Store-level `true` cannot override a disabled global or consumer gate. Custom catalogs must also contain the KV definitions to collect these metrics.

To opt out of installation for an ASU store, add `enable_metrics: false` beside `store_pipeline: "ASU"` in its existing `ucm_connector_config`. This setting controls installation, not per-store filtering or shutdown: the backend is process-wide, and setting it to `false` does not uninstall a backend already installed by another store. Direct C++ callers only have the store installation switch and must arrange UCM metric registration and draining themselves.

#### Updating KV definitions

Edit `kv_semantics/metrics/config/kv_metrics.yaml`, then run from the repository root:

```bash
python kv_semantics/metrics/tools/generate_kv_metrics.py --sync-ucm
python kv_semantics/metrics/tools/generate_kv_metrics.py --check
```

Commit the source, generated C++ descriptor header, and generated KV blocks in `examples/metrics/metrics_configs.yaml` and `ucm/default_metrics_config.py` together. `--check` detects stale outputs without writing files and runs in the `metrics-python-tests` CI job.

For custom deployment catalogs, synchronize the KV definitions and run `python kv_semantics/metrics/tools/generate_kv_metrics.py --ucm-config /etc/ucm/metrics_configs.yaml` separately (requires PyYAML). Pass the metrics catalog, not the serving configuration. Every KV definition must appear exactly once with matching type, documentation text and buckets; extra custom metrics are allowed. `--ucm-config` cannot be combined with `--check` or `--sync-ucm`. Use unquoted decimal bucket values such as `0.00001`, because YAML 1.1 may parse `1e-5` as a string.

## 2. Raw Metrics Usage

### 2.1 Hit Rate

Use a layered calculation instead of calculating each Store hit rate independently. First calculate the total hit rate at the boundary of two adjacent cache layers. Then split that total according to the actual load-source ratio reported by those layers. This keeps the numerator and denominator semantics consistent across the hierarchy and provides the most accurate tier-level estimate.

For example, the external-cache hit rate can be calculated from vLLM token Counters:

```text
external_cache_hit_rate = external_hit / external_query
                          * (1 - hbm_hit / hbm_query)
```

For a Cache | Posix pipeline, split the external-cache hit rate using shard Counters:

```text
cache_share = (cache_load_shards - cache_load_wait_shards)
              / cache_load_shards
posix_share = cache_load_wait_shards / cache_load_shards

cache_hit_rate = external_cache_hit_rate * cache_share
posix_hit_rate = external_cache_hit_rate * posix_share
```

Apply the same approach to other layered Stores: calculate their combined hit rate first, then split it using Counters that represent the actual load source. Use `rate()` or `increase()` over the same time range for every Counter in a formula, and do not mix token, block, and shard counts within the same ratio.

### 2.2 Bandwidth

UCM exposes two useful bandwidth views with different meanings:

- The `*_bandwidth_gbps` Histograms record effective bandwidth for individual tasks. They show instantaneous task speed and its distribution, such as p50, p90, and p99, but they do not represent total system throughput.
- Average system bandwidth should be calculated as total transferred bytes divided by elapsed time. It includes concurrency and idle periods, so it represents the overall throughput observed during the selected time range.

Use a cumulative byte Counter for the required Store and transfer direction. For example:

```promql
sum(rate(ucm:cache_load_bytes_total[$__rate_interval])) / 1e9
```

Equivalently, for a fixed time range:

```text
average_bandwidth_GBps = increase(transferred_bytes_total) / elapsed_seconds / 1e9
```

Sum byte rates across workers before converting to GB/s. Keep Load and Dump, or read and write, as separate series. Do not average per-task bandwidth values to estimate system throughput.
